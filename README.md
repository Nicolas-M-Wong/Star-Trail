# Star-Trail

The aim of this program is to create what we call in astrophotography star trail. Star trail photography are simply successive pictures taken on a excessive length of time so that we can perceived the movement of the stars in the night sky due to rotation of the earth. With DSLR camera, we can take multiple picture succesively instead of one very long picture to get approximately the same effect, then we stack then and get on picture with the star trail.
